# PACMAN CAPTURE THE FLAG - CONTEST SUPPORT SCRIPT #

This script can be used to run a Berkley Pacman Conquer the Flag Contest (http://ai.berkeley.edu/contest.html).

Designed & developed for RMIT COSC1125/1127 AI course in 2017 by lecturer A/Prof. Sebastian Sardina (with programming support by Marco Tamassia), 
based on an original script from Dr. Nir Lipovetzky developed for UNIMELB COMP90054 AI course in 2014. 
Since then, the tool has been continously improved and extended by Nir and Sebatsian to fit both subjects' needs.

## OVERVIEW ##

This system allows to run a full Pacman Capture the Flag tournament among many teams using a cluster of machines. 
This means that it allows to run many games at the same time, depending how many total cpu cores are available.

The system takes the set of teams, set of workers in a cluster, and tournament configuration (which layouts and how many steps per game), 
runs games for every pair of teams and layouts (round-robin type of tournament), and produces files and html web page with the results.

The system contains two main scripts:

1. ```pacman_ssh_contest.py``` is the main script to actually run a contest.
2. ```pacman_html_generator.py``` generates an HTML web page from existing data of already ran contests.


To see options available run: 
```
python pacman_ssh_contest.py --help
```

```
python pacman_html_generator.py --help
```


### Features ###

* Cluster support to run many games at the same time.
    * option `--workers-file <json file>`
    * connection via ssh with tunneling support if needed.
* Can use variable number of fixed layouts and randomly generated layouts.
    * options `--no-fixed-layouts` and `--no-random-layouts `
* Flexible configuration via many command line options.
* Map individual student submissions to teams.
    * Via student-team mapping file; option `--team-names`
    * Mapping each filename.zip submission as teamname=filename; option `--ignore-file-name-format`
* Generate HTML page with tournament results and list of replay files.
    * ability to store replays and logs into https://transfer.sh to avoid filling your local www space
    * Ranking generation:
        * 3 points per win; 1 point per tie. Failed games are loses.
        * Order by: points first, no. of wins second, score points third.
* Handle latest submission by sorting via timestamp in file name.
    * all members of a team can submit at any point
    * last submission per team is considered (if there are multiple)
    * this is done by mapping individual submission to a team via `--team-names-file` and timestamp in zip submission file
* Automate tournament using a `driver.py` script and `cron`
    
    
## PRE-REQUISITES ##


### Software requirements in cluster and local machines

* In **each machine in the cluster**:
    * unzip & zip (to pack and unpack submissions and files for transfer)
        * `sudo apt-get install -y unzip zip vim`
    * Python >=2.7 with standard libraries (the UC Pacman Contest runs under Python 2 version, not 3).
    * Set the sshd server to accept as many connections as you want to run concurrently. This is done by changing option `MaxStartups` in file `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`. By default sshd has up to 10 connections.
        * For example, set `MaxStartups 20:30:60` to accept up to 20 simultaneous connections. Remember to restart the ssh server: `sudo service sshd restart`
        * For more info on this, see issue #22.
    * Cluster should have all the Python and Unix packages to run the contest. For example, in the NeCTAR cluster:

            sudo apt-get update
            sudo apt-get install python-pip unzip vim
            sudo pip install setuptools
            sudo pip install -r requirements.txt
            
        If you do not have root access you can use `pip install -r requirements.txt --user` to do a user install. Get [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) with wget.

    * Many students benefit from the availability other tools, like [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/), [neat-python](https://github.com/CodeReclaimers/neat-python): 
        * `pip install tensorflow sklearn sklearn scipy neat-python --user` or `sudo pip install tensorflow sklearn scipy neat-python`

* In the **local machine** that will dispatch jobs to the cluster via `pacman_ssh_contest.py` script:
    * unzip & zip (to pack and unpack submissions and files for transfer): `sudo apt-get install -y unzip zip`
    * Python >= 3.5 with:
           * setuptools
           * python-future
           * future
           * iso8601
           * pytz
           * paramiko
    * Simply run: `pip install -r requirements.txt --user`
        * Observe we use pip (Python 2.7+) because the server will run the actual Pacman capture.py script (which uses Python 2.7)




In addition to that:

* Each submission is a .zip file or a directory; they should all go in a directory (e.g., teams/)
    * The agent system is in the root of the team zip file or team directory.
    * The name convention of a submission file/dir will depend on `--team-names-file` option.
    
* If option `--team-names-file` is passed, then submission file/dir names will be treated as student number and will be
mapped to team names using mapping .csv file provided. Otherwise submission file/dir name will be used as team name. 
    * zip/dir should start with "s", continue with student number, then _, and then date in iso8601 format 
        (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601), then .zip
    * Format stored regexp SUBMISSION_FILENAME_PATTERN: r'^(s\d+)_(.+)?\.zip$'
    * Examples of legal team zip files:
        - s2736172_2017-05-13T21:32:43.342000+10:00
        - s2736172_2017-05-13.zip
    * Examples of team directories:
        - Destructor_Pacman-05-13T21:32:43.342000+10:00
        - WeWillWin-05-13
    * The student number will be mapped to a team and the timestamp will be used to pick the latest team submission.

* The cluster to be used is specified with option `--workers-file-path`, to point to a `.json` file containing the workers available (including no of cores, IP, username, password, and private key file if needed)

Hence, user must provide:

- *private keys* for cluster (if needed; specified in workers.json)
- Directory with set of zip submission files; see above (for option `--teams`)
- `workers.json`: listing the cluster setting to be used (for option `--workers-file-path`)
- TEAMS-STUDENT-MAPPING.csv [optional]: a csv mapping submissions to teams (for option `--team-names-file`)
    - Main columns are: STUDENT_ID and TEAM_NAME
    - If **no file provided**, teamnames are taken from the submitted zip files (this is the option used at unimelb)


## HOW THE SCRIPT WORKS ##


### Main components: ###

- `driver.py`: downloads teams from submissions server, runs `pacman_ssh_contest.py` and upload results into the web.
- `pacman_ssh_contest.py`: main script
- `cluster_manager.py`: the script to manage clusters
- `contest.zip`: the actual main contest infrastructure, based on that one from UC (with minor fixes, e.g., delay in replays)
- `layouts.zip`: some interesting layouts that can be used (beyond the randomly generated ones)
- `staff_team_{basic,medium,top}.zip`: the teams from staff, used for `--include-staff-team` option. 
    - You can point to the directory containing all three staff agents using `--staff-teams-dir` (default is current dir)
	- You can use your own basic, medium, top agents, as long as they are named accordingly.  
	- If you want to use our agents, co ntact us. These teams are not shared as they are used for marking purposes. So, if
	    you get access to them, please do not distribute.
- `contest/` subdir: developing place for `contest.zip`. The .zip file should contain all files in the root of the .zip
- `TEAMS-STUDENT-MAPPING.csv`: example of a mapping file


### Overview of marking process: ###

1. The script authenticate to all workers.
2. Then the script will collect all the teams. 
- If option **--ignore-file-name-format** is given, then it will simply collect the teamnames from the <teamname>.zip files, otherwise:
    - Will collect each file with pattern s<student number>_<timestamp>.zip
    - If student number is not registered in any team as per mapping given by _--team-names-file_ then the file is 
    ignored (we do not know which team it corresponds) and the following message is issued:
        ````
        Sun, 24 Sep 2017 15:25:48 WARNING  Student not registered: "s123456" (file test-teams/s123456_2017-05-15). Skipping
        ````
    - If student is found in a team but submission has wrong timestamp, then it is also ignored as we cannot know if it 
    is the latest submission for the team. A message is issued:
        ````
        Sun, 24 Sep 2017 15:25:48 WARNING  Team zip file "test-teams/s5433273" name has invalid date format. Skipping
        ````
3. The script will _use contest.zip_, _layouts.zip_ (where some fixed layouts are stored) and a set of teams and:
    1. create a temporary full contest dir _contest-tmp_
    2. zip it into _contest_and_teams.zip_ file
3. For each game:
    1. transfer  _contest_and_teams.zip_ to an available worker
    2. expanded in /tmp/cluster_xxxxxxx
    3. run game
    4. copy back log and replay to marking machine. 
    


### Example of a run: ###

Using a csv file to specify team names, include staff teams:
````
python pacman_ssh_contest.py --compress-log \
        --organizer "RMIT COSC1125/1127 - Intro to AI" \
        --teams-root AI17-contest/teams/  \
        --team-names-file AI17-contest/AI17-Contest-TEAMS.csv  \
        --www-dir www/ \
        --max-steps 1200 \
        --no-fixed-layouts 5 --no-random-layouts 10 \
        --workers-file workers.json \
        --staff-teams-dir AI17-contest/staff-teams/
````
Collecting submitted files in teams, and using the zip filename as teamname, and uploading the replays file only into a sharing file service instead of your local directory:
````
python pacman_ssh_contest.py --compress-log \
        --organizer "RMIT COSC1125/1127 - Intro to AI" \
        --teams-root AI17-contest/teams/  \
        --www-dir www/ \
        --max-steps 1200 \
        --no-fixed-layouts 5 --no-random-layouts 10 \
        --workers-file AI1-contest/workers/nectar-workers.jason  
        --staff-teams-dir AI17-contest/staff-teams/
        --upload-www-replays
````

### Example of generating web page from statistics: ###

Build web page in www/ from stats, replays, and logs dirs:
````
python pacman_html_generator.py --organizer "Inter Uni RMIT-Mel Uni Contest" \
    --www-dir www/ \
    --stats-archive-dir stats-archive/  \
    --replays-archive-dir replays-archive/ \ 
    --logs-archive-dir logs-archive/
````

or if all stats, replays, and logs are within <www-dir> then just:

````
python pacman_html_generator.py --organizer "Inter Uni RMIT-Mel Uni Contest" --www-dir www/
````

**Observation:** If the stats file for a run has the transfer.sh URL for logs/replays, those will be used.

## SCHEDULE COMPETITION ##


If you want to automate the tournament, use the `driver.py` provided. It has the following options:

```
  --username [USERNAME]
                        username for --teams-server-url
  --password [PASSWORD]
                        password for --teams-server-url
  --dest-www [DEST_WWW]
                        Destination folder to publish www data in a web
                        server. (it is recommended to map a web-server folder
                        using smb)
  --teams-server-folder [TEAMS_SERVER_FOLDER]
                        folder containing all the teams submitted at the
                        server specified at --teams-server-name
  --teams-server-url [TEAMS_SERVER_URL]
                        server address containing the teams submitted
  --tournament-cmd [TOURNAMENT_CMD]
                        specify all the options to run pacman-ssh-contesy.py
  --cron-script-folder [CRON_SCRIPT_FOLDER]
                        specify the folder to the scripts in order to run cron
```

#### Test command to schedule ####

We strongly recommend to test the command you want to schedule in **cron**

Run the following command:
```
crontab -e
```

and introduce the following line into **cronfile** (change *username* appropriately)

```
# For more information see the manual pages of crontab(5) and cron(8)
# 
# m h  dom mon dow   command

* * * * *  /usr/bin/env > /home/username/cron-env
```

Now you can test the command you want to schedule by running
```
./run-as-cron /home/username/cron-env "<command>"
```

This will run you command with the same environment settings as cron jobs do. If the command succeeds, then you can set up your command now.

#### Setting up cron ####

Run the following command:
```
crontab -e
```
Remove the line you introduced before and introduce the following line:
```
# For more information see the manual pages of crontab(5) and cron(8)
# 
# m h  dom mon dow   command

01 00 * * * python driver.py --username xxx --password xxx --cron-script-folder ''  --dest-www '' --teams-server-folder '' --teams-server-url xxx --tournament-cmd ''
```

Now your script will run every midnight at 00:01


## TROUBLESHOOTING 

* Cannot connect all hosts with message: _"Exception: Error reading SSH protocol banner"_
    * This happens when a single host has more than 10 CPUs.
    * The problem is not the script, but the ssh server in the cluster. By default it does not accept more than 10 connections. 
    * Configure `/etc/ssh/sshd_config:` in the host with `MaxStartups 20:30:60`
    * Check [this issue](https://bitbucket.org/rmitteaching/pacman-contest/issues/22/ssh-problems-with-10-cluster-machines)
